# Circles Benchmark

This is an adaption of Jeremy Ashkenas classic Animating Circles comparison. Originally this was used to illustrate the performance difference between Backbone and Ember but was copied and editted over JSFiddle for the better part of a decade. Almost all of those are gone now so I thought I'd update it and try to consolidate it here.

I do not claim to be an expert in every framework but try to do my best to optimize each implementation. Pull Requests welcome.
